## The AI-Xray Chronicles" 🤖📷📚
🎉 Hold on to your hats, folks, because I've got a story for you! 📖

Once upon a time, in the midst of a global pandemic 🌍😷, a passionate student of Artificial Intelligence 👨‍💻🤖🔍 was looking for a way to contribute to society and help out in any way they could. And that's when they stumbled upon a dataset of chest X-rays 💻📷

The student realized that this dataset could be used to train an image classification model that could help diagnose COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal chest X-rays with high accuracy 📈👨‍⚕️

And so, during the pandemic, the student took on the challenge of creating and training a ResNet-18 model using PyTorch 🚀💻🔍 They divided their project into several tasks, from importing libraries to visualizing data to training the model itself ⚙️🎨🎉

## The Quest for Accurate Diagnoses" 🚀🔍💻
The project, therefore, aims to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with high accuracy.

🔍 Task 1: Introduction
💻 Task 2: Importing Libraries
📷 Task 3: Creating Custom Dataset
🎨 Task 4: Image Transformations
🚚 Task 5: Prepare DataLoader
📈 Task 6: Data Visualization
🤖 Task 7: Creating the Model
⚙️ Task 8: Training the Model
🎉 Task 9: Final Results

And now, here we are, with a powerful image classification model that can help diagnose COVID-19 and other chest X-ray abnormalities with high accuracy 💪👨‍⚕️📈

So let's give it up for our dedicated AI student, who used their skills to make a difference during a difficult time 🙌👏👨‍💻🤖
